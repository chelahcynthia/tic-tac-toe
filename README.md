## How to Play
When the game starts, Player 1 is assigned "X", and Player 2 is assigned "O".

Players take turns clicking on an empty square on the grid to place their symbol.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all the squares are filled, and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.
